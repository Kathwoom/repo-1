Output:
Initial Deque:
[Daily, A, Fruit,  and Vegetable,  are , Good, for Health]

Deque contents using Standard Iterator:
 Daily A Fruit  and Vegetable  are  Good for Health

Deque contents using Reverse Iterator:
 for Health Good  are   and Vegetable Fruit A Daily

Deque Peek: Daily
Deque, After peek: [Daily, A, Fruit,  and Vegetable,  are , Good, for Health]

Deque Pop: Daily
Deque, After pop: [A, Fruit,  and Vegetable,  are , Good, for Health]

Deque Contains Three: false

Deque, after removing first and last elements: [Fruit,  and Vegetable,  are , Good]
